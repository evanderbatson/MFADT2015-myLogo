The logo for the thesis show is a grid of 100 dots. Everyone in the show can submit their own custom specimen of the logo that will appear on their individual project page. There are thematic and visual guidelines for designing your logo in the brand bible that will be sent out by the design committee on the listserv. These logos can either be submitted as a static PNG file (boring), or drawn as a dynamic animated JS canvas object (awesome).

We are using the library P5 (http://p5js.org/) which makes drawing on the HTML5 canvas easy and in the same syntax as Processing. Code class from bootcamp will finally pay off! We have created a .js template here, so simply fork it and create your own version. 

Finished? Submit your final .js file for approval to [batse087@newshcool.edu](mailto:batse087@newschool.edu?subject=[DynamicLogo]) with the subject [Dynamic Logo] before May 1st.
